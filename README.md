# CUBETHON

### Short Description

My first game using Unity in C# was a thrilling and enjoyable experience that helped me learn a lot while having fun. The game, called CUBETHON, involved controlling a cube as it navigated through obstacles and avoided falling off the platform.
I implemented many Unity concepts, including collision detection, object pooling, and UI design, to create a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
I also included multiple levels of difficulty, which increased in complexity as the player progressed through the game.

Overall, creating CUBETHON was a fantastic way to develop my C# and Unity skills, and I'm excited to continue exploring new game development concepts and ideas.
